**************How to run****************
1. make
2. Program accept 4 parameters
	dataLen: the length is gonna to write and reed into file system 
		s for short
		m for medium
		l for long
	reader number: how many reader threads
	writer number: how many writer threads
	BLOCK_SIZE: the BLOCK_SIZE
		s for 512
		m for 1024
		l for 2048
3. Example ./final s 1 1 s
   This means run final with short dataLen, 1 reader thread, 1 writer thread, long BLOCK_SIZE

************ Total Design ***********************
1. There are 4 variables as parameters
2. I use control variate method to set parameters.
3. Read time and wait time are what we concern, so
4. Each time we run, print out the read wait time and write wait time for analysis
5. For each experiment, I did it for 5 times then get the average time for analysis

************* Implementation Design *****************
char *files[4]: There are 4 different file names.
char *dirs[5]: There are 5 different directory names.

There are 3 different functions for threads to run
	1. reader thread
	2. writer thread
	3. directory thread 

reader thread:
	1. randonly pick up a file names from files
	2. record the start time
	3. read from disk
	4. record the finish time
	5. add difference time to readWait;
write thread:
	1. randonly pick up a file names from files
	2. record the start time
	3. write to disk
	4. record the finish time
	5. add difference time to readWait;
directory thread:
	1. randonly pick up a directory operation and a directory name
	2. do this operation on the directory name
	3. This won't affect reader writer time
