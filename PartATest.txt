Part A Test Design
	make
	./test
	input a command
	command format:
		mkdir 	string(name of directory)
		cd		string(name of directory)
		rmdir		string(name of directory)
		open	string(name of file)
		close	int(fd of file want to close, which print by open)
		read	int(fd of file want to close, which print by open)
		write	int(fd of file want to close, which print by open)
				data
		seek	int (fd of file want to close, which print by open)
				int (seek point, if is larger than file size, it will set to end of file)
		rm		string(name of file)
		ls
		quit
	the result will print on the screen
	the ls command will show current directory usage
	the quit command the quit the test
	the close/read/write/seek command need a int as input, which is the fd print after calling open command

	
Test Result

	ls
	We are in: /
	mkdir a1
	ls
	We are in: /
			a1      1
	cd a1
	open b1
	Descriptor for b1: 3
	write 3 hello
	read 3
	hello
	seek 3 1
	read 3
	ello
	mkdir a2
	ls
	We are in: a1
			b1      0
			a2      1
	rmdir a2
	ls
	We are in: a1
			b1      0
	close 3
	read 3
	ERR(read): file is closed
	seek 3 2
	ERR(seek): file is closed
	write 3 olleh
	ERR(write): file is closed
	quit
